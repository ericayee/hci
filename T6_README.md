# IS 4300 Team Project

## T6: Team Assignment #6 – Computer Prototyping
Prototype: [ericayee.com/hci-t6/](https://ericayee.com/hci-t6/)

#### About the application
Finding Your Way is a redesign of Northeastern’s Degree Audit, showing what courses a student has completed and must complete to finish their degree. A user opens the web application via a link from the myNortheastern portal.

#### Tasks
1. Determine the number of requirement categories you need to satisfy in your current degree.
2. List what courses would count for your Presentation requirement in your current CS degree.
3. You’re considering changing your major. View the degree requirements for the Mechanical Engineering major in catalog year 2020.

The prototype should be immediately accessible without any installation process [here](https://ericayee.com/hci-t6/).
